# React Native Native Animations

This project demonstrates how to implement three different types of animations (fade-in, slide-in, and rotation) in a React Native app using native modules written in Java. This solution ensures smooth performance and optimal use of native device capabilities.

## Features
- **Fade-in Animation**: A component fades in when it enters the screen.
- **Slide-in Animation**: List items slide in from left to right, each with a slight delay.
- **Rotation Animation**: A button rotates 360 degrees when pressed.

## Technology Stack
- **React Native**: Frontend framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.
- **Java (Android)**: Native modules written in Java for optimal animation performance.
- **iOS (Optional)**: You can extend the native modules to Objective-C/Swift for iOS compatibility.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following tools installed:
- Node.js
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, optional)
